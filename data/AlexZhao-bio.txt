I am a senior at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) and Business Administration.
I'm interested in the effects of machine learning on human behavior. Some of my past research has been on recommender systems and robust machine learning. I love to read and write. Some favorites are Catch-22, Steppenwolf, and Tropic of Cancer.
I am passionate about the future of news and work as Data Projects Editor at The Daily Californian.
