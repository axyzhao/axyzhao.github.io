  <h3>1. What impact do you want to have on the world and why?</h3>

  For me, my mission is telling stories about biases in technology through data. The journalism industry is in the midst of a crisis—increasingly, people are drawn to online
  free sources of information and prefer rapid sound bites over thoughtful news. Yet the
  need for robust, evidence-backed journalism has never been greater. Both policy and
  public attitudes are shaped by journalism, but trust in news is falling. Evidence-backed
  journalism bridges the gap by centering news on facts rather than the author. I aspire to
  a career in data journalism, a form of journalism that enhances news by drawing
  insights and visualizations from datasets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Communicating technical ideas to a lay audience has never been a simple task. Yet I
believe that data journalism, by employing interactivity and insights distilled from data,
can broaden the scope of news to novel problems in technology.
</p>
<p>
  Journalists have helped expose explicit biases in technology; for instance, Wired
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-algorithms-struggle-recognize-black-faces-equally/">reported</a> that Microsoft's facial recognition model had lower accuracy on non-white
people. Yet journalists remain inadequate at unearthing implicit prejudices embedded
in everyday algorithms. In 2019, the Department of Housing sued Facebook for allowing
advertisers to restrict the audience of their housing ads. I believe journalists, not the
government, are best suited to to shine a light on opaque algorithms which foster
discrimination.
</p>
<p>
  Data journalists are just starting to borrow techniques from statistics and computer science. In particular, journalists might apply ideas from computer science literature to examine the feedback loop between humans and machines.

  <h3>2. Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you.</h3>

Fans of the New York Times' Crossword form a sort of secret society, complete with weekly rituals, veiled adages, and cryptic references to Yoko Ono. In a tradition since high school, my family and I gather around the dining table to collaborate on the Monday crossword. Each of us contributes a gradual patchwork of guesses until—aha! a theme is revealed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doing crosswords as a family took on a special importance when my mom was diagnosed with cancer. The serenity of putting our heads together for a weekly puzzle was a constant in a tumult of appointments. During my mom’s treatment, I felt like a bystander—frustrated that I could not find new doctors or pay for the long bills.
</p>
<p>
  Prodded by my urge to feel useful, I began poring over her medical costs. Through phone interviews and Time's <a href="https://time.com/198/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/">coverage</a> of chargemasters, I encountered the erratic realm of healthcare pricing. Though I expanded my understanding of medical bills, I was disgruntled by the lack of accessible, data-driven reporting on healthcare's opaque cost structure. Their anecdotes were compelling, but Time only scratched the surface when it came to harnessing datasets.
</p>
<p>
Since then, my mom's cancer has gone into remission. I realized along the way that simple compassion, in the form of a crossword or a hot cocoa, is sometimes the most we can do. Even while I commit to a long-term mission, I strive to give whatever I can in the confines of the present.
