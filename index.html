						<p>I love the outdoors and the feeling of smallness in the middle of a vast world. In 1711, literary critic Joseph Addison wrote that
							beauty is found whenever the mind encounters something so "Great, Uncommon, or Strange" that it changes what we considered possible. California, with its vast mountains and forests, is doubtless Great and Uncommon.</p>

									<p style="color: white">
										In spring 2018, I worked with the Center for Carbon Removal (now Carbon180),
										a non-profit dedicated to supporting carbon capture, to forecast trends in carbon sequestration technologies.
										I created data visualizations that mapped the movement of carbon from feedstocks to final products,
										which were presented by Carbon180 to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2018. </p>

					<h2 style="font-weight: bold;"> Quantifying polarization of presidential candidates</h2>
					<p style="color: white;"> During the 2016 election, I gained valuable experience applying quantitative techniques to political questions. As an intern at University of California Irvine's Ethics Center,
						I worked with Professor Kristen Monroe to research the presidential election through the lens of political psychology.
						I organized teams of volunteers to perform qualitative analysis on hundreds of interviews from candidates,
						implemented statistical techniques in Python and R, and analyzed trends on political polarization in the United States.
					</p>
				        <img src="republican.jpg" alt="" />

					<p style="color: white;">
						Applying the concept of integrative complexity from political science, which measures complexity in cognition, I measured each Republican and Democratic candidate based on past interviews.
						We found that in 2016, Democrats scored higher on the complexity scale in questions of foreign policy, while both parties were low on questions of domestic policy.
						I presented the results of my research as the lead author of the project (“Integrative Complexity in Election Cycles”)
						at the International Society of Political Psychology's annual conference. </p>

					<h2 style="font-weight: bold;"> Recommending sizes to users by the Transformer architecture</h2>
					<p style="color: white;"> In summer 2018, I worked as an algorithms research intern at Zalando, the largest e-commerce company based in Europe.
						Based on advances in natural language processing, I implemented a model in Pytorch from scratch to improve Zalando’s size recommendation algorithm. 
						I trained our model on five years of purchase history and achieved record accuracy across the board. Along with two other researchers, I co-authored a conference paper on attention-based 
						recommendation engines that we submitted to ACM SIGIR 2020.</p>
					<center><img src="attention.png" alt="" /></center>
					<p style="color: white;"> Above, you can see an example prediction made by the recommendation model we built. The Transformer is a groundbreaking advance in natural language processing which has changed the way we think about the future of artificial intelligence.
						My contributions were to demonstrate the usefulness of the Transformer in the recommendation setting, where users and items are dynamically shifting.
						This model is uniquely scalable and has the benefits of offering interpretations of the model's predictions. This is particularly important when recommending sizes for clothing to
						customers who may be sensitive about the topic.</p>

					Here is a small sample of the quotes I have gathered -- hope you enjoy some of them.</p>

					<center><p><i>On lies</i><p></center>
					<center><p style="color: white; font-size:small; font-family:courier">  "Herr! gieb uns blöde Augen für Dinge, die nichts taugen, und Augen voller Klarheit in alle deine wahrheit.<br/>
							(Lord! Give us weak eyes for things that do not matter and eyes full of clarity in all your truth.)"<br/>
							--Søren Kierkegaard, Sickness Unto Death</p></center>

					<center><p><i>On sunrises</i><p></center>
					<center><p style="color: white; font-size:small; font-family:courier">  "It seemed to him that he could see the yellow day opening peacefully on before him, like a corridor,
							an arras, <br/>into a still chiaroscuro without urgency."<br/>
							--William Faulkner, Light in August</p></center>
					<center><p><i>On freedom</i><p></center>
					<center><p style="color: white; font-size:small; font-family:courier">  "Make them aware of the possibilities they have denied themselves or the passiveness they have
						displayed in situations where it was really necessary to cling to the heart of the world, like a splinter - to force, if needed, the rhythm
						of the world's heart, dislocate, if needed, the system of controls; but in any case, most certainly, to <i> face the world. </i>" <br/>
						--Frantz Fanon, Black Skins, White Masks (emphasis added)</p></center>
